Restool v3.1
v3.1.2 [9/26/2012]
-Added more documentation.
-Started work on tool to fix internet settings.
	+IPConfig/renew /release /flushdns
	+Restart Cisco NAC service.

v3.1.1 [9/2/2012]
-Uninstall Removal Tools should now work without any issue on 64-bit machines.
	+May fail on 32-bit machines, haven't tested that and I have no desire to
	 set up a virtual machine right now.
-Removed a lot of commented out code, including Fsecure.
-Added some more documentation boxes, as always though, more need to be added.

v3.1 [9/1/2012]
-Installs Malwarebytes correctly (tested many scenarios, hopefully it will be flawless now.)
-More documentation boxes, still need to add more.
-Added global variables for commonly accessed paths, such as the ResTech folder.
-Uninstall Removal Tools button is now functional.
	+It needs to uninstall one program at a time, currently it tries to do them all at once.
	 Sometimes this works, othertimes it results in a HUGE mess.
	+This WILL not remove programs that were already installed, if the download file does not
	 exist in the ResTech folder, the program will not be removed.
-Spybot Automation Fixed
	+This will now install/run using a batch file. It works on my computer, needs testing at
	 ResTech still. It SHOULD work though.
-Fsecure only exists in comments now, it WILL be fully removed whenever 3.2 is released.

TODO's
-Clean up the code more.
-Break up the fileStarter method into several smaller ones for added flexibility.
-Work on the Uninstall Removal Tools button more.
